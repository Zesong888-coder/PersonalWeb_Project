            <h2>AI-Assisted Course Creation in VR (Holos)</h2>
            <p class="degree">Agile Team Project, Unity, Vue.js, Node.js</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spearheaded the development of an innovative AI-assisted course 
                    creation platform in VR, steering the design and implementation
                    phases with a focus on cutting-edge technology. </li>
                <li>Implemented a cutting-edge 3D character interaction system 
                    using Unity and incorporated voice input for a highly immersive and
                    personalized learning experience. </li>
                <li>Validated the solution's efficacy through comprehensive testing, 
                    contributing to Holos' mission to revolutionize education through
                    accessible and engaging VR learning. 50 users were tested and 95% 
                    user satisfaction was obtained </li>

            <h2>Reconstruct files in Filesystem</h2>
            <p class="degree">C programming</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recovered all image files from an ext2 disk image by writing a 
                    custom file carving tool in C. Utilized file system structures and
                    metadata to identify and reconstruct lost files. </li>
                <li>Analyzed and modified file system utilities such as mkfs and debugfs to improve file recovery capabilities. 
                    Contributed to the opensource community by submitting bug fixes and new features.  </li>
                <li>Developed a machine learning-based approach to predict the location of lost files 
                    on an ext2 file system. Achieved a 90% accuracy
                    rate on a test dataset, demonstrating the potential for automated file 
                    recovery in forensic investigations.  </li>
